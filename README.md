# Distributed_System_project
My distributed system projects. They are liteminer, Tapestry, Raft and Puddlestore

# Go_Project
All my distributed system projects. All these projects are team projects with members of 2. The original repository is a private course repository, and Professor doesn't allow us to public these projects. Therefore, I create this repository and clone all the projects here. This repository is only used for the Skycoin interview. When the interview is done, I will delete this repository.
If you want to run my project locally, you should run the following command to download my code into your go path:

```
go get github.com/YimingLiBrown/Distributed_System_project
```
